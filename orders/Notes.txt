Type 'Document<any, any>' is not assignable Error
In the upcoming lecture, we will be writing some tests and then running the test suite to ensure they are passing.

You will likely end up with this TS error in your terminal along with a failed test:

   src/models/ticket.ts:47:5 - error TS2322: Type 'Document<any, any>' is not assignable to type 'Condition<LeanDocument<TicketDoc>> | undefined'.

      Type 'Document<any, any>' is missing the following properties from type 'LeanDocument<TicketDoc>': title, price, isReserved

To suppress this error, find the following line in the existingOrder function of models/ticket.ts:

    ticket: this,
Change it to:

    ticket: this as any,
Complete function for context:

  const existingOrder = await Order.findOne({
    ticket: this as any,
    status: {
      $in: [
        OrderStatus.Created,
        OrderStatus.AwaitingPayment,
        OrderStatus.Complete,
      ],
    },
  });
