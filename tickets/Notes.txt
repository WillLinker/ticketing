globalThis has no index signature TS Error
In the upcoming lecture (and later with the orders and payments services) you may end up seeing a TS error like this in your test/setup.ts file:

Element implicitly has an 'any' type because type 'typeof globalThis' has no index signature.ts(7017)

This is caused by a recent change in the @types/node library which is a dependency of ts-node-dev.

To fix, find the following lines of code in src/test/setup.ts:

declare global {
  namespace NodeJS {
    export interface Global {
      signin(): Promise<string[]>;
    }
  }
}
change to:

    declare global {
      var signin: () => Promise<string[]>;
    }
